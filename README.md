# 📘 Exercises for TDT4172 – Introduction to Machine Learning

This repo hosts my three core assignments from **TDT4172 – Introduction to Machine Learning** at NTNU.  
It’s all above-board: just the assignments and nothing else. 🚀

## 📂 What’s Inside
- 🔹 **Assignment 1** – Tackle a supervised learning task (likely regression or classification) using **scikit-learn**, focusing on data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.  
- 🔹 **Assignment 2** – Build and train **neural network models** with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, exploring model architecture, tuning hyperparameters, and handling training challenges.  
- 🔹 **Assignment 3** – Explore **reinforcement learning** (e.g. Q-learning or simple agent-based learning), applying it to a decision-making or control-style problem.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Everything is implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks** (`.ipynb`), primarily using:  
- 🐍 Python  
- 🔬 TensorFlow  
- ⚙️ Keras  
- 📊 scikit-learn
